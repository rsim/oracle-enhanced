  * automatically generated too long index names are shortened down to 30 characters

  * changed cursor_sharing option default from 'similar' to 'force'
  * optional dbms_output logging to ActiveRecord log file (requires ruby-plsql gem)

    to http://github.com/eyestreet/active_record_oracle_extensions)
  * raise RecordNotUnique and InvalidForeignKey exceptions if caused by corresponding ORA errors
    (these new exceptions are supported just by current ActiveRecord master branch)
  * implemented disable_referential_integrity

  * add_foreign_key and add_synonym are also exported to schema.rb
* Bug fixes:
  * [JRuby] do not raise LoadError if ojdbc14.jar cannot be required (rely on application server to add it to class path)
  * [JRuby] 'execute' can be used to create triggers with :NEW reference
  * support create_table without a block
  * support create_table with Symbol table name
  * use ActiveRecord functionality to do time zone conversion

  * Sequence creation for tables with non-default primary key in create_table block
  * Do count distinct workaround only when composite_primary_keys gem is used
    (otherwise count distinct did not work with ActiveRecord 2.1.1)

    (see http://rsim.lighthouseapp.com/projects/11468/tickets/11-rake-dbtestclone_structure-fails-in-117)
